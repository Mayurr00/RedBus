# Inter-city bus booking portal like Red Bus
RedBus is an innovative application developed by our team during the Summer Internship Hiring Hackathon. Our team, consisting of seven talented individuals, joined forces to create a user-friendly website that simplifies the process of booking bus tickets. With RedBus, users can easily find and book bus tickets according to their preferences, making their lives more convenient and hassle-free.

# Problem Statement
The current lack of a comprehensive platform for commercial bus operators to list their vehicle running schedules and available seats, coupled with the absence of a user-friendly interface for passengers to select desired dates and seats and make bookings, creates a significant challenge for both operators and passengers. This gap in the market results in a time-consuming and inefficient process for operators to manage their schedules and for passengers to find and book bus tickets. Therefore, there is a need for an app or website that enables bus operators to easily list their schedules and seat availability, while providing passengers with a convenient platform to browse, select, and book available dates and seats efficiently.

# Technology used
The technology used in the development includes HTML,CSS, Javascript, Flask, MySQL.
1. HTML is the standard markup language used for creating web pages. It was used to structure the content of our web application.
2. CSS is a stylesheet language used for describing the presentation of web pages. We used CSS to style the user interface and make it visually appealing.
3. JavaScript was used to implement dynamic seat booking features in the app or website. Through JavaScript, we were able to enable real-time seat selection, update seat availability based on user actions, and dynamically display chosen seats, providing an interactive and seamless booking experience for passengers.
4. Flask, a lightweight Python web framework, was utilized to handle the back-end functionality of the app or website. It allowed us to create routes, handle requests from users, and generate dynamic content. Flask's simplicity and flexibility enabled efficient development, routing of URLs, and integration of HTML templates.
5. MySQL was used as the database management system for storing and managing data related to bus schedules, seat availability, operator details, and passenger bookings. We designed the database schema and used SQL queries to interact with the database, retrieve information, and perform necessary operations for data management.
